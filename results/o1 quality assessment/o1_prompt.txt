You are tasked with evaluating the quality of the modelâ€™s outputs for six conditions. In each condition, the model has been given the same five stream-of-consciousness semantic chunks and asked to classify Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) in each chunk. A prompt and input create a condition. For each condition, review the provided samples and assess the outputs according to the following criteria:

Criteria for Evaluation:
Logical Soundness and Relevance:

Does the justification logically support the assigned trait classification ("y", "n", or "NaN")?
Is the reasoning sound, internally consistent, and relevant to the established definition of the Big Five traits?

Textual Grounding (and Feature Grounding):

Is the justification clearly grounded in the provided text chunk and any associated programmatic or semantic features?
Does it reflect the content accurately and avoid making unsupported claims?
Confidence Score Appropriateness and Calibration:

Does the confidence score appropriately reflect the strength, clarity, and grounding of the justification?
Are confidence scores well-calibrated across the samples in the condition?

Absence of Hallucination:

Does the model avoid hallucinating information (e.g., inventing or inferring details not present in the input text or features)?

Accurate Interpretation:

Does the model accurately interpret the meaning of the text and features?
Does it avoid misinterpreting the tone, intent, or specific details of the input?

Instructions:

For each condition, systematically evaluate the samples using the above criteria. Use the text and input_extra to evaluate the model_output. If the input colum is input_1, there is no input_extra.
Provide a brief summary of your findings for each criterion within the condition.
Highlight specific examples from the samples to illustrate strengths or weaknesses 

Notes:
Pay special attention to how the model uses "NaN" to indicate insufficient input data. This reflects its ability to recognize when a reliable prediction cannot be made.

Provide actionable feedback if you identify trends or recurring issues across samples.

After evaluating all conditions, identify the two best-performing conditions as well as the two worst overall, and provide a brief rationale for why.
